RBI Digital Lending Guidelines (DLG) Compliance Checklist
1. Disbursement & Repayment Flow
Direct Transfer: Ensure all loan disbursements are made directly to the borrower's bank account without any third-party "pass-through" or pool accounts.

Repayment Directness: All repayments must be executed directly from the borrower's account to the Regulated Entity (RE) without any intervention by Lending Service Providers (LSPs).

Exception Handling: Explicitly document any statutory exceptions or co-lending arrangements that deviate from the direct-flow rule.

2. Transparency & Disclosure (KFS)
Key Fact Statement (KFS): Provide a standardized KFS to every borrower before the loan contract is signed, detailing the Annual Percentage Rate (APR).

Fee Clarity: Ensure no "hidden" charges are levied; all fees must be explicitly mentioned in the KFS and cannot be charged unless disclosed.

Look-up Period: Include a mandatory "cooling-off" or look-up period where the borrower can exit the loan by paying the principal and pro-rata APR without penalty.

3. Technology & Data Privacy
Consent Framework: Implement "Prior and Explicit" consent for any data collection, with a clear option for the borrower to withdraw consent or "forget" data.

Data Localization: Ensure all biometric data is stored only on systems located within India as per RBI's data residency requirements.

Minimalist Access: Audit LSP mobile app permissions to ensure they do not access files, media, or contact lists unless strictly necessary for credit underwriting.

4. Grievance Redressal
Nodal Officer: Designate a specific Nodal Grievance Redressal Officer to deal with digital lending-related complaints.

30-Day Resolution: If a complaint is not resolved within 30 days, the borrower must be informed of their right to lodge a complaint with the RBI Ombudsman.
